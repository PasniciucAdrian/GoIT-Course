About

This repository documents my journey through the Manual Tester course at GoIT Academy.

I completed a series of practical exercises during the course, all of which are organized in the respective folders in this repository.

My transition into the QA field began with a long-standing desire to explore software testing. I first enrolled in an online course to ensure that the field aligned with my interestsâ€”particularly in terms of enjoyment, comprehension, and challenge.

After completing the introductory course, I knew this path was right for me. I decided to deepen my knowledge and enrolled in a professional manual testing course to learn directly from industry experts.

The GoIT course laid a solid theoretical foundation in QA and offered hands-on experience that helped me understand how manual testing is applied in real-life scenarios.
