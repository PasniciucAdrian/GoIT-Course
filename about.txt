I attended a Manual Tester course at GoIT Academy. This contains the exercises I completed during the course.

My professional reconversion began with a long-standing desire to take a testing course. Initially, I enrolled in a course on a learning platform to ensure that it was a suitable fit for me in every aspect (enjoyment, understanding and challenge).

After completing the first course, I realized it was exactly what I was looking for and enrolled in another course to learn directly from professionals about manual testing.

The course at GoIT helped me lay the theoretical foundations of testing and also provided practical insights into how manual testing works.
