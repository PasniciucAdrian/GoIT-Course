Exercise 2 â€“ Test Cases and Bug Reports

This exercise involved writing at least five test cases and executing them on a specific web application. Based on these test cases, five bug reports were created, following the provided template.

The goal was to test both positive and negative scenarios. For example, one negative test involved trying to log in using an incorrectly formatted email address.

The test cases were created in a structured format including:
- Step-by-step actions
- Test data
- Expected result

The bug reports documented:
- Pre-conditions
- Steps to reproduce
- Actual result
- Expected result
- Severity, priority and environment

This practical activity provided valuable experience in identifying issues and documenting them properly, contributing to a deeper understanding of QA processes.
